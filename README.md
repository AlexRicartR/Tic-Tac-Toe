# Tic-Tac-Toe 

Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as nought and crosses) is one of the oldest games in the world. In the game, two players take turns to put either a nought or a cross into a grid that measures 3x3 (three columns across and three rows high). One player only places noughts in the boxes and the other only places crosses. 

In this version, it also was included a single player option that allow the user to play against the computer.
